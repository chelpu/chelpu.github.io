        "description": "I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. I have a passion for teaching others and have been an instructor's aide for two classes. I have also had two internships in software engineering at Detroit Labs in Detroit, MI and Twilio in San Francisco, CA. In my spare time, I like to create iOS applications, listen to music (currently my favorite is Philip Glass), read autobiographies, and buy stationery to add to my collection."
